# Open Computer Orchestration
**Self Hosted (On Premise) Desktop and Server Inventory, Software Deployment & Mobile Device Management**

The Open Computer Orchestration (OCO) project enables IT administrators to centrally manage Linux, macOS and Windows machines plus Android and iOS (Mobile Device Management / Enterprise Mobility Management) using a comfortable web interface. It provides software deployment features, a user-computer logon overview, policy management, lists software packages installed on each computer ("recognised software/apps") and features a fine-grained permission/role system.

It focuses on easy usability (UI/UX), simplicity (assessable code with minimal external dependencies) and performance (manage many devices with minimal server resources). The self hosted (on premise) approach and open source code base ensures a digital sovereign operation without vendor lock-in.
