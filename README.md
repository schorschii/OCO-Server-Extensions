# Open Computer Orchestration
**Self Hosted / On Premise Desktop and Server Inventory, Management & Software Deployment**

The Open Computer Orchestration (OCO) project enables IT administrators to centrally manage Linux, macOS and Windows machines using a comfortable web interface. It provides software deployment features, a user-computer logon overview, lists software packages installed on each computer ("recognised software") and features a fine-grained permission/role system.

It focuses on easy usability (UI/UX), simplicity (assessable code with minimal external dependencies) and performance (you can manage many computers with minimal server resources).
